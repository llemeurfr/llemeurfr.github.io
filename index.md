The Readium Projects primary goal is to provide rock-solid, performant building blocks and applications for EPUB3 publications. There are currently three separate projects underway: 

- The ReadiumJS project which is developing a JavaScript library and viewer for EPUB 3 rendering optimized for use to render EPUB files directly from websites and in browser-based “cloud” readers;
- The Readium SDK project which is developing a compact, performant EPUB 3 rendering engine optimized for use in native apps for tablets and other devices;
- and Readium LCP (Licensed Content Protection), a sub-project of Readium SDK, for the implementation of  DRM technology.

Information on all three projects can be found [here][readium-github-io]
