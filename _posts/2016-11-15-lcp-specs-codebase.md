Readium LCP (“Licensed Content Protection”) establishes a vendor-neutral interoperable DRM (Digital Rights Management) ecosystem for eBooks and other digital publications, with public specifications and open-source software. 

## Published documents

The specifications of the Readium LCP DRM are now public:

[Readium Licensed Content Protection (LCP) 1.0](/readium-lcp-specification/) defines a standard license format for expressing rights and restrictions associated with protected EPUB 3 Publications. It also defines a processing model for Reading Systems to verify user specific licenses and access encrypted resources.

[Readium License Status Document 1.0](/readium-lsd-specification/) defines a standard status document format for representing the status of a DRM license along with interactions that might affect its status. One of the primary objectives of this specification is to support lending in public libraries where a user may have the ability to renew a time-limited loan or cancel one before it expires.

## Open-source software

### Readium LCP Client library 

The Readium LCP Client library, written in C++, is very easy to deploy as a “content module” in a Reading System based on the Readium SDK. It’s code may be adapted to any other Reading System implementation.

<!-- &gt; Download it on: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/readium/readium-lcp-client) -->

&gt; The github repository containing this reference implementation will be made public in December 2016.

### Readium LCP Server 

The multi-platform reference Readium LCP Server is written in Golang. It provides a command line utility for content encryption, a Readium LCP License Server and a License Status Server. The REST API allows for a seamless integration with front-end systems and offers immediate interaction with Readium LCP compliant Reading Systems.

&gt; The github repository containing this reference implementation will be made public in December 2016.

## Be part of the Readium LCP ecosystem
The interoperability and security of the Readium LCP ecosystem will be guaranteed by EDRLab (European Digital Reading Lab), i.e. the European Readium headquarter. This implies a specific encryption profile, different from the basic one defined in the LCP specification, and a secure implementation of this encryption profile. 

For more information about how to be part of the Readium LCP ecosystem ecosystem, please [contact EDRLab](https://edrlab.org/edrlab/contact).
